# Rackmaster.com website

## Description
*Duration: 1 week*

I recently built a simple website for the company Rackmaster Systems, Inc. located in Eden Praire, MN. It's a single page website and displays basic information about the company. It contains the company's address, contact information, a description of the business, and a link to it's ISO 9001 certification. This project was also my first time making a website fully responsive, it will display on mobile, tablet as well as a wide screen monitor.
